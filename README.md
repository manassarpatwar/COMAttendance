The system is intended for 3 types of users:
Student users
Lecturer users
Admin users
 
 
### Significant Features/Technology
The system has the following:
 
##### Students
- Students can login to the system using their university credentials. If it is their first time logging in, an account will be automatically created for them.
- Students can enter a session code given to them by a lecturer for a particular session in order to register as present for that session.
- Students can view which sessions they have attended in the past by accessing the history page from the dashboard.
- Students can scan a QR code provided by the lecturer which will take them to a page where they can log in and then confirm their attendance at that particular session in order to log in. This is an alternative to signing in using a code.
 
 
##### Lecturers
- Lecturers can sign into the system using their university credentials.
- Lecturers can create new sessions from the dashboard by navigating to the new session page - sessions can be created by specifying title, start time and end time.
- Lecturers can register other lecturers to their session.
- Lecturers can display the session code for an upcoming session.
- Lecturers can see a list of upcoming sessions on their dashboard. This is filtered by week.
- Lecturers can edit an existing sessionâ€™s details and update the same details as when they created the session.
- Lecturers have the option to delete an upcoming session of theirs.
 
##### Admins
- Initially there is a single admin that is able to create new lecturers and admins that will use the attendance system.
- These other admins will be able to log into an admin dashboard with their university credentials once they have been given admin privileges by the admin.
- The administrators will use the system to download SAM reports for past sessions as csv files - which should contain all of the required information automatically.
- The past sessions are accessible from the dashboard in chronological order.
- Admins can create sessions in bulk from the dashboard by uploading a csv file.
